cleanup:
    use board::sync() to batch up and send display writes, audio updates, and display mode changes
    separate out APPLE2Einterface from board
        pass just mode flags in vector presized to, let's say, 16?
        translate in lambda before passing to APPLE2Einterface
    templatize Board?
    deglobalize where possible
    lower and underscores throughout
    audio popping
    Mockingboard
    DHGR
    colors bleed incorrectly
        probably could convert color on CPU to make it slightly easier
Run this software then purge fake6502:
    ProDOS
    LodeRunner
    ChopLifter
    Digitizer
    Plasmania
    Christmas Carols
    Data Capture //e
    Contiki no network
    Idiom Translator
    Pascal - Brad's Disk
    ...?

final release:
    help screen?
    gamepad calibration screen (for desktop GLFW anyway)?
        need to handle asynchronous gamepad arrival (a la HTML5)
    screenshots for README.md
    link to emscripten version

emscripten:
    safari misses 'V' for some reason
    why is it running slow in Chrome?
        runs fast in Safari and Firefox.  :-/
    upgrade to 1.37, see if -O2 issue is fixed
    audio
    paste somehow
        store paste event contents into a variable, copy that in GLFW clipboard routines?
    floppies
        IDBFS, local storage initialized from DOS 3.3 floppy and other floppies
        copy into IDBFS from other web pages
        drag and drop from IDBFS into floppy icons
    make rasterization less ugly
        retina canvas?
        limit to integer-zoomed pixels?
    GLFW - gamepad using HTML5 gamepad interface
        note that it doesn't show up until initially used
